Cumbria is the second largest county in England, custodian of the much-loved Lake District National Park, celebrated on a global scale as a UNESCO world heritage site. Our economy is tightly connected with our natural environment and four of our six districts councils have
declared a climate emergency.

There is currently no requirement for schools to engage in environmental initiatives; it is not
one of OFSTEDS criteria; environmental initiatives within schools rely upon the motivation
and altruism of staff and students. Despite this, throughout the county and nation, there are
countless examples of school groups and communities taking action to protect planet and
minimise our impact on it. These awards are the opportunity for schools to show case their
efforts, be rewarded for them and inspire others.

As young people rise in action and advocacy for environmental protection the time is right to celebrate their successes, share ideas and
collaborate across the county, raising the profile and movement of environmentalism, in schools across the county.

## Aims:

1.  To celebrate environmental initiatives that are taking place in schools, both primary and secondary, around the county through a series of awards.
2.  To create a forum for support and idea sharing between schools on environmental initiatives in an eco-innovation day.
3.  Provide start-up funds to support school environmental initiatives.
