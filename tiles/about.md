Our community is inextricably linked to the environment: the drama of the lakes and fells, the beaches and salt marches of the Solway Firth, the mudflats of Morecambe Bay or limestone of the upper Eden and forests of Ennerdale or Grizedale. Young people across Cumbria have joined global action and advocacy for environmental protection. The Cumbrian Ecoforum has two aims.

## Aims:

1. To hold an annual school award competition and celebrate and reward the winners in a high profile environmental awards ceremony.
2. To have every school in Cumbria engaged in environmentalism. Supported by
    1. An eco-connections hub - support and information resource for schools starting out or at any stage in their environmental journey.
    2. Start up grants for environmental initiatives.
