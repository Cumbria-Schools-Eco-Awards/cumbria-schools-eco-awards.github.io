Our community is inextricably linked to the environment: the drama of the lakes and fells, the beaches and salt marches of the Solway Firth, the mudflats of Morecambe Bay and forests of Ennerdale or Grizedale. Young people across Cumbria have joined global action and advocacy for environmental protection. The Cumbrian Ecoforum has two aims.

## Aims:

1. To have every school in Cumbria engaged in environmentalism. Supported by
   1. An eco-connections hub - support and information resource for schools starting out or at any stage in their environmental journey.
   2. Start up grants for environmental initiatives.
2. To celebrate and reward the best schools in the county through an annual competition.
