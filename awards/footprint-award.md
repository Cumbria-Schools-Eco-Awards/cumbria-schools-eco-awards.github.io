How is your school working to minimise or mitigate its environmental footprint? How ‘green’
is your school ethos? How is your school empowering both staff and students to take
individual and collective action to safeguard the natural world. This award category is for
schools to show case either a single initiative or the range of activities that take place in and
around school. This might include long term ongoing projects and/or one-off events. These
may be whole school activities or undertaken by a smaller subset of students and teachers
however the emphasis should be on demonstration action and quantifiable impact.
