At the awards ceremony, finalists will present their school projects and the winners of each category will be announced.

We are hugely buoyed by the extent of schools' involvement in environmentalism. There is a vast bank of knowledge and a very encouraging enthusiasm amongst our schools.

The Schools' Environmental Awards Day will also become our annual environmental education seminar. It provides an opportunity to bring schools together, with experts in environmental action and education, to share ideas and build networks. There will be workshops, discussion sessions, displays and networking opportunities. Whether you have an established set of environmental activities taking place in school or are just starting out exploring ideas, there will be something of value.



### New Date to be announced

Due to the current situation with the coronavirus, we have had to postpone the school's environmental awards which were due to take place Friday 13th March.

A new date will be chosen as soon as we feel able to do so.

Thank you to everyone for their interest in and support of the event

The award ceremony will take place at Sedbergh School. There is the opportunity for all schools in the county to attend what will be a fascinating series of talks and workshops on environmentalism. Finalist schools presenting their projects to judges will offer a great opportunity for visiting  teachers/students to be inspired. A full programme of the day's events will become available in the New Year.

> "It is a huge pleasure to be associated with these fantastic Awards in their inaugural year. Environmental issues must remain in all of our minds; and especially the younger generation, we must educate and energise. We have seen a real sea change here at Sedbergh with increased awareness of threats to our planet and it has made me very proud to watch our own Eco Sedbergh Society grow as fast as any I can remember. I am sure the Awards will be a huge success and I urge all pupils and schools to get involved and make a difference".
