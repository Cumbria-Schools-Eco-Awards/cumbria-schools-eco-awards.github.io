At the awards ceremony finalists for the awards will present their school projects and the winners of each category announced.

We are incredibly excited by what is happening in schools and there is an incredible amount of knowledge and enthusiasm amongst our schools. The Schools' Environmental Awards Day will also become our annual environmental education seminar. It provides an opportunity to bring schools together, with experts in environmental action and education, to share ideas and build networks. There will be workshops, discussion sessions, displays and networking opportunities. Whether you have an established set of environmental activities taking place in school or are just starting out exploring ideas, there will be something of value.

Hosted at Sedbergh School.
