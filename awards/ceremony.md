At the awards ceremony, finalists will present their school projects and the winners of each category will be announced.

We are hugely buoyed by the extent of schools' involvement in environmentalism. There is a vast bank of knowledge and a very encouraging enthusiasm amongst our schools.

The Schools' Environmental Awards Day will also become our annual environmental education seminar. It provides an opportunity to bring schools together, with experts in environmental action and education, to share ideas and build networks. There will be workshops, discussion sessions, displays and networking opportunities. Whether you have an established set of environmental activities taking place in school or are just starting out exploring ideas, there will be something of value.

### 13th MARCH 2020

The award ceremony will take place at Sedbergh school on the 13th March 2020. There is the opportunity for all schools in the county to attend what will be a fascinating series of talks and workshops on environmentalism. Finalist schools presenting their projects to judges will offer a great opportunity for visiting  teachers/students to be inspired. A full programme of the day's events will become available in the New Year.
