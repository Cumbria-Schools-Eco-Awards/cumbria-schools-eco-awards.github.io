Schools may submit up to 1 entry for each award category. Our judges will look at every application in isolation and only when choosing the overall Cumbrian Environmental School of the Year will we consider multiple applications from one school together.

The application process is not designed to be onerous and therefore we are avoiding being overly prescriptive. We want you to explain your work in a way that suits your school the best. We do want to avoid schools submitting large quantities of extra paperwork, although if there are supporting documents or items that you feel help showcase your good work please contact us.

Think broadly about what your school does. The environment is at the heart of everything, even if your school does not yet have many activities that are obviously earmarked as environmental you might be surprised about how much your school already does. Big impacts can be made by simply doing lots of small obvious stuff. Think broadly and tell us what you do – you might even surprise yourself.

### Application process

1. School entry form – submit only one per school. This is to tell us a little bit more about your school and the context for the environmental initiatives you are doing.
2. Award submission – one application per category
   1. Video presentation – a 5 min video to illustrate what your school is doing. We do not expect you to be professional cinematographers, although you may have some very talented students, teachers or parents who can help.
   2. Supporting documents – a written summary of project (s) to support and further explain the projects summarised in your video.
