    for the wildlife and people of Tanzania quickly led him into community-based conservation
    work and he has played a significant role in highlighting the plight of the nationâ€™s
    embattled elephant population, whilst running community projects such as Doctors
    on Safari.\n\nHe has also worked with national parks and community members in
    Slovakia, focusing on human/bear conflict issues around mountain resort towns.
    \n\nSchools environmental education has increasingly become his focus and he is
    commencing programmes to connect students from around the world with their natural
    environment and with each other.\n\nThe Cumbrian schools eco awards and forum
    evolved as a result of his shock at the lack of government support or recognition
    for those schools intent on reducing their individual footprint. He hopes it will
    help pull together the burgeoning community of concerned and mobilised folk, all
    of whom share the dream of a county full of truly global citizens who understand
    the impact of their actions on the planet.   \n"
