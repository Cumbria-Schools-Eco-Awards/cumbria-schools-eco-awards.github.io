  conservation biologist working on finding evidenced based solutions to conservation 
  issues ranging from economics of sustainable Oil Palm production to using traditional 
  institutions to halt lion killing. In 2013 she returned with her daughter to her home in 
  Cumbria and trained to be a teacher. She has worked in schools across the county and 
  currently   teaches Biology at the Lakes School. She is passionate about linking her 
  environmental conservation with education. She has led fieldwork expeditions for students 
  both locally and internationally. She was a National Geographic Explorer and currently sits
  on the committee for the Royal Geographical Society’s regional division. 
  A keen (although slow) fell runner and paddleboarder she wouldn’t want to live anywhere 
  else in the UK."

  description: "David has been a safari operator in Tanzania for 30 years. His passion
    for the wildlife and people of Tanzania quickly led him into community-based conservation
    work and he has played a significant role in highlighting the plight of the nation’s
    embattled elephant population, whilst running community projects such as Doctors
    on Safari.\n\nHe has also worked with national parks and community members in
    Slovakia, focusing on human/bear conflict issues around mountain resort towns.
    \n\nSchools environmental education has increasingly become his focus and he is
    commencing programmes to connect students from around the world with their natural
    environment and with each other.\n\nThe Cumbrian schools eco awards and forum
    evolved as a result of his shock at the lack of government support or recognition
    for those schools intent on reducing their individual footprint. He hopes it will
    help pull together the burgeoning community of concerned and mobilised folk, all
    of whom share the dream of a county full of truly global citizens who understand
    the impact of their actions on the planet."
